      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello! I'm Hope Tsai, a rising junior hailing from the mitten state of Michigan; I don't go to a high school--I've been homeschooled since middle school, and take my classes online and through dual-enrollment. The laws regarding homeschooling are lax in Michigan (they don't really care what I do), so I take the SAT, SAT subject tests, and AP exams to validate my schooling. My mom doesn't teach me anymore, but she used to in middle school. Anyways, I live in West Bloomfield Township with my family of five; my dad is a realtor and my mom is in charge of my schooling and the household. I have a twin sister named Love, who plans to go to med school after undegrad and become an anesthesiologist--she also has a pet dog named Aiko. We live in a pretty large house with a great front yard, back yard, and patio; there's greenery everywhere, and you don't really see other people until the summertime. Common activities to do include going to the cider mill in the fall, meeting Santa in the mall during Christmastime, hurriedly switching to shorts and T-shirts in the spring, and lounging around in the summer. <p>
      <p> Aspirations: I long to be able to travel the world when I graduate college; that's something my parents have instilled in me since my infancy. So far, I've been to Taiwan (my parents' home country), California, Ohio, Canada, Japan, and Illionis! Other items at the top of my bucket list include publishing some writing, watching a musical on Broadway, seeing a notable ballet company like ABT or the Kirov put on a production, and going scuba diving.</p>
      <p>College Dreams + Computer Science + Girls Who Code: My plans of becoming an English teacher have been dashed; my mom convinced me that I would not be able to do any of my hobbies on that salary. She was also, once, a teacher; she hated it and does not want that life for me. So, she convinced me to apply for Girls Who Code, and here I am! I'm hoping that I like computer science after these seven weeks, otherwise I'll be back to square one with English; I love the city, so I'm mainly only looking at colleges in urban areas.</p>
      <p>Hobbies: I enjoy dancing in my spare time; I mostly dance ballet, and this next school year, I'll be dancing five days a week--so yes, this takes up most of my time and energy. Other hobbies of mine include reading, writing, and making music (I can play the piano, and I'm busy learning the ukulele right now). Sometimes, I sketch and make little graphic designs of quotes to put up in my bedroom.</p>
      <p>Likes: the color yellow, food, music, books, summer, dancing, cities, people</p>
      <p>Dislikes: patronizing/condescending people, being late</p>
      <p>Fun Fact: I'm Taiwanese-American!</p>
