        <p>Hello! I'm Hope Tsai, a rising junior hailing from the mitten state of Michigan; I don't go to a high school--I've been homeschooled since middle school, and take my classes online and through dual-enrollment. The laws regarding homeschooling are pretty lax in Michigan (they don't really care what I do), so I take the SAT, SAT subject tests, and AP exams to validate my schooling to colleges. My mom doesn't teach me anymore, but she used to in middle school. Anyways, I live in West Bloomfield Township with my family of five; my dad is a realtor and my mom is in charge of my schooling and the household. I have a twin sister named Love, who plans to go to med school after undegrad and become an anesthesiologist--she has a pet dog named Aiko, and he's the pet of the family. We live in a pretty large house with a great front yard, back yard, and patio; there's greenery everywhere, and you don't really see other people until the summertime because we're all busy staying warm and cozy in our houses. Common activities to do include going to the cider mill in the fall, meeting Santa in the mall during Christmastime, hurriedly switching to shorts and T-shirts in the spring, and lounging around in the summer. </p>
        
      <p><b>Aspirations:</b> I really want to be able to travel the world when I graduate college; that's something my parents have instilled in me since my infancy. So far, I've been to Taiwan (my parents' home country), California, Ohio, Canada, Japan, and Illionis! Other items at the top of my bucket list include publishing some writing, watching a musical on Broadway, seeing a notable ballet company like ABT or the Kirov put on a production, and going scuba diving.</p>
        
      <p><b>College Dreams + Computer Science + Girls Who Code:</b> My plans of becoming an English teacher were dashed a long time ago; my mom convinced me that I would not be able to do any of my hobbies on that salary. She was also, once, a teacher; she hated it and does not want that life for me. So, she convinced me to apply for Girls Who Code, and here I am! I'm hoping that I like computer science after these seven weeks, otherwise I'll be back to square one with English; anyways, I'm having a blast in the city of Chicago and am very excited to see what the future will bring! </p>
        
      <p><b>Hobbies:</b> I enjoy dancing in my spare time; I mostly dance ballet, and this next school year, I'll be dancing five days a week--so yes, this takes up most of my time and energy. Other hobbies of mine include reading, writing, and making music (I can play the piano, and I'm busy learning the ukulele right now). Sometimes, I sketch and make little graphic designs of quotes to put up in my bedroom.</p>
        
      <p><b>Likes:</b> the color yellow, passion fruit, tea, bookmarks, postcards, food, music, books, summer, dancing, cities, people, sunshine, animals, concerts, Marvel movies, Wonder Woman, Doctor Who, Harry Potter</p>
        
      <p><b>Dislikes:</b> patronizing/condescending people, being late, being sick, rain, being too cold or too hot, pain</p>
        
      <p><b>Harry Potter classification <3 :</b> Hufflepuff, Pukwudgie, dolphin patronus, 10" silver lime wood wand with unicorn hair and slightly yielding bendyness
        
      <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> I'm Taiwanese-American!</p>

      <p><b>Recent Happenings:</p></b>
      <p>Just today (June 30th, 2017), we finished our side-scrolling game! Developed by Hannah, Berenice, and myself, it's called "Under the Sea" and features a diver as the character. The person playing needs to avoid obstacles like fish, sharks, and seaweed, while aiming to get air bubbles to increase his or her air supply. When the time (increased by getting air bubbles) hits zero, you lose! The object of the game is to continually get a higher score every time you play.</p>
      <p style="text-align:center;"><b>Projects</p></b>
  <p><b>Obamicon:</b> Back in 2008, Shepard Fairey designed a poster of Barack Obama that used only red, blue, and beige. It's now a global icon; we took Fairey's idea and created a code that would take a picture and convert it to red, blue, and beige based on the intensity of the pixel's color. The Obamicon project focused on loops and conditionals in Python; one hugely helpful part of the whole process was writing up a pseudocode before going technical.</p>
  <p><b>Drawing Shapes in Python and Scratch:</b> This code was designed to take in an input (the number of sides for the computer to draw) and draw a shape based on the input, which would be the output. This was easier to do in Scratch than in Python; in Scratch, all the code available was there in the program, and all I had to do was drag and drop the correct block of code into the workspace. It was logical and pretty straightforward. In Python, I had to type up the entire code, and all I had were a few lines of code that I had to string together.</p>
  <p><b>Paddleball:</b> The paddleball game consists of two people playing on the computer using the right and left arrow keys and the A and D arrow keys; the goal is to keep the ball bouncing on the platform. It took a long time to get the ball to bounce off the platform and the walls; the easier part was designing the score variable. If I had had more time, I would've wanted to focus on the physics of the ball, so that it would look more realistic.</p>
  <p><b>Robots:</b> Switching from Scratch and Python to robots and Arduino was a big change; suddenly, we had to learn all of the hardware in a robot in addition to a new programming language. Wiring the robot took some time getting used to, and sometimes the robot wouldn't work because of the wiring, and not because of the code. Sometimes, a piece would blow out (like an LED) and we wouldn't be able to use it, but we would spend a long time laboring over the code and the wiring before deciding to try switching out the LED. More frustration equals more excitement when it works, though, and in the end, it was like the robot was a lil' baby.</p>
