        <!-- Fill in the row for Variables -->
        <tr>
        <td><b>Variables</b></td>
          <td>A variable is a changeable bit of information; it can be conveyed into the code as a word, phrase, or number. You can first set the variable, and then change the variable as the code runs.</td>
          <td>I start off the day with a box of thirteen doughnuts; however, every time I encounter a friend of mine, one doughnut gets taken away from the set. Soon, by the end of the day, the box is empty.</td>
          <td>A variable can be the color of the pen in the Draw Shapes project; the color is not set until the user input question is answered. The variable then changes to suit the user input. </td>
          <td>The score in our Scratch side-scrolling game is a variable; it is first set at zero, and increases by one point each second while decreasing if the player hits an obstacle.  </td>
        </tr>

        <!-- Fill in the row for Loops -->
        <tr>
          <td><b>Loops</b></td>
          <td>Loops are used to repeat a section of code either a certain number of times, forever, or until a condition is true.</td>
          <td>Breathing is a forever loop. Eating a bowl of cereal is a loop that ends once the condition (an empty bowl) is true.</td>
          <td>I used a loop in Python to draw shapes; the loop would repeat (x number of sides) as skips = t.forward(100) and skips = t.left(360/x number of sides).</td>
          <td>For Scratch, I did the same thing as I did in Python, but I didn't have to type everything out; I just dragged the repeat (x) block.</td>
        </tr>

        <!-- Fill in the row for Conditionals -->
        <tr>
          <td><b>Conditionals</b></td>
          <td>A conditional is an if-then statement; it says that, basically, if X condition is true, then Y action must follow. It helps the computer make choices based on what scenario it encounters.</td>
          <td>At the bus stop: if the 157 bus is here, then board the bus. If the 157 bus is not here, wait.</td>
          <td>Did not use in Python yet.  </td>
          <td>In Scratch, conditionals were used to end the side-scrolling game. If the score variable is less than zero, then switch to gameover backdrop and stop all scripts.  </td>
        </tr>

        <!-- Fill in the row for Functions -->
        <tr>
          <td><b>Functions</b></td>
          <td>A function shortens a block or section of code down into a singular word or phrase. Then, in the main code, you can use the word/phrase instead of typing out the entire block of code again.</td>
          <td>When I was just learning how to tie my shoelaces, my mom had to repeat each step for me to follow. As I grew older, all I had to do was think about tying my shoelaces, and I automatically did each step without having to go through all of them explicitly.  </td>
          <td>In Python, you type "def" to create a function, but I haven't used them yet.  </td>
          <td>In Scratch, for the side-scrolling game, we had to deduct points from the score every time the player hit an obstacle. As the score variable needed to change every single time the diver hit an obstacle, we wrote down the code under a define block and just used the "change score" define block instead of writing down the code for each obstacle.  </td>
